leaflet.wms.js
==============

An all-in-one WMS plugin for Leaflet.
-------------------------------------

[Leaflet] is great for tiled maps, but has limited support for WMS.  This is by
design: after all, the core motivation for Leaflet is to make [the basic things
work perfectly](http://leafletjs.com/features.html) and not to support every
use case.

That said, there are still use cases where more robust WMS support is needed.
For example, small scale applications (e.g. for local governments) that
integrate multiple custom WMS layers from one source.  Loading these layers
individually via `L.TileLayer.WMS` is problematic:
 
 * The default tile size will result in many duplicate labels for vector-backed
   layers.
 * The browser can be overwhelmed when using a large tile size or displaying
   many layers at once.

Various workarounds have been proposed to address some of these issues, most notably
in [Leaflet.NonTiledLayer](https://github.com/ptv-logistics/Leaflet.NonTiledLayer).
The goal of this project to bring all of these concepts and more into a single,
comprehensive WMS plugin for Leaflet.

## [Demo](http://heigeo.github.io/leaflet.wms)

## Features 

 * "Single-tile" auto-updating WMS overlay
 * Use single server-composited image for layers coming from the same source
 * Layer identify via `GetFeatureInfo`
 * Pull requests welcome!

> **Note:** this plugin officially only works with Leaflet 1.0.  There is an [unsupported patch](https://github.com/heigeo/leaflet.wms/pull/8) that works with Leaflet 0.7, though it's not kept up to date.

## Usage

```javascript

// Default usage (uses L.WMS.Overlay)
var source = L.WMS.source("http://example.com/mapserv", {
    'transparent': true
});
source.getLayer("layer1").addTo(map);
source.getLayer("layer2").addTo(map);

// Tile mode (Uses L.WMS.TileLayer)
var s = L.WMS.source("http://example.com/mapserv", {
    'transparent': true,
    'tiled': true
});
source.getLayer("layer1").addTo(map);
source.getLayer("layer2").addTo(map);

```

leaflet.wms can be loaded via AMD, CommonJS/Node, and browser global environments.

```javascript
// AMD example
define(['leaflet', 'leaflet.wms'],
function(L, wms) {

// L.WMS === wms;
var source = wms.source("http://example.com/mapserv");

});
```

## API

leaflet.wms provides four layer classes (and shortcut lowercase functions) that facilitate working with WMS layers.  To get the most out of leaflet.wms, it's generally best to just use the [L.WMS.Source] virtual layer, which creates other layers automatically.

### L.WMS.TileLayer

This class is (currently) identical to [L.TileLayer.WMS].  It provides a simple interface for loading tiles from a WMS service.

```javascript
var tiles = L.WMS.tileLayer("http://example.com/mapserv", {
    'tileSize': 512,
    'layers': 'layer1,layer2',
    'transparent': true
});
tiles.addTo(map);
```
``
### L.WMS.Overlay

This class provides a "single-tile"/untiled/non-tiled WMS layer.   Every time the map is panned or zoomed, a new WMS image will be requested for the entire display.  To make transitions smoother, the existing image will be kept visible until the new one is loaded.  An internal [L.ImageOverlay] instance is created for this purpose. (This technique was inspired by the [esri-leaflet] plugin.)

The API is nearly identical to `L.WMS.TileLayer`, except that the tile options do not apply.

#### Events
**`wms.loading`** - fired before requesting external service;

**`wms.load`** - fired after data from external service has been received;

**`error`** - forwarded from internal `L.ImageOverlay` instance.

```javascript
var overlay = L.WMS.overlay("http://example.com/mapserv", {
    'layers': 'layer1,layer2',
    'transparent': true
});
overlay.addTo(map);
```

### L.WMS.Source

`L.WMS.Source` is a virtual Leaflet "layer" that manages multiple WMS layers coming from a single WMS source.  
By using the same source for multiple layers, you can have the WMS service composite the image, 
and avoid overloading the client with multiple large images. 
`L.WMS.Source` is a virtual layer, as it does not load the WMS image directly.  
Instead, it creates an internal `L.WMS.Overlay` or `L.WMS.TileLayer` to handle the actual loading.

Like the other WMS layers, `L.WMS.Source` takes a URL and an options object as initialization parameters.
The options are passed on to the underlying `Overlay` or `TileLayer`.
An additional option, `untiled`, toggles whether to use `Overlay` or `TileLayer`.
The default is `true`, which uses the non-tiled `Overlay`.
Unless your WMS service is optimized for tiling, the default should provide the best performance.
To use the `TileLayer`, set `untiled` to `false`.
You can also set `tiled` to `true`, which will both use the `TileLayer` backend and
set `tiled=true` in the WMS request (see [#16](https://github.com/heigeo/leaflet.wms/issues/16).

`L.WMS.Source` forwards all `L.WMS.Overlay` or `L.WMS.TileLayer` events and provides two functions for toggling on and off individual WMS layers (`addSubLayer` and `removeSubLayer`, respectively).  That said, it is usually more convenient to use `L.WMS.Layer` instances (described next).

```javascript
var options = {'transparent': true};
var source = L.WMS.source("http://example.com/mapserv", options);
source.addSubLayer('layer1');
source.addTo(map);
```

### L.WMS.Layer
`L.WMS.Layer` is a virtual Leaflet "layer" that facilitates Leaflet-style operations on individual WMS layers.  For example, you can "add" a `L.WMS.Layer` to a map, and the corresponding `Source` will automatically be updated (instead of actually adding a new overlay to the map).  `L.WMS.Layer` is particularly useful in conjunction with Leaflet's built in layer control.  L.WMS.Layer takes three arguments: a `source`, a `layerName`, and the WMS `options` object.  The `source` can be a source object or a URL.  If a URL is given, a source object will be created from the URL if it doesn't exist already.

For convenience, `L.WMS.Source` provides a `getLayer` function that will generate a `L.WMS.Layer` already bound to the source object.  It's usually better to use this feature instead of creating `L.WMS.Layer` instances directly.

```javascript
// Okay (implicit source)
var options = {'transparent': true};
var layer1 = L.WMS.layer("http://example.com/mapserv", "layer1", options);
var layer2 = L.WMS.layer("http://example.com/mapserv", "layer2", options);
// layer1._source === layer2._source
var control = L.control.layers({}, {
    'Layer 1': layer1,
    'Layer 2': layer2
})
control.addTo(map);
```
```javascript
// Recommended (explicit source)
var options = {'transparent': true};
var source = L.WMS.source("http://example.com/mapserv", options);
var layer1 = source.getLayer('layer1');
var layer2 = source.getLayer('layer2');
var control = L.control.layers({}, {
    'Layer 1': layer1,
    'Layer 2': layer2
})
control.addTo(map);
```

### Identify (GetFeatureInfo)

`L.WMS.Source` includes an `identify()` feature that can call the WMS GetFeatureInfo service to query a map layer and return information about the underlying features.  To disable this functionality, set `options.identify` to `false` when initializing the source.  The default functionality places a popup on the map at the point where the user clicked.  To customize the functionality, create a class extending `L.WMS.Source` and override one or more of the provided hooks.

```javascript
var MySource = L.WMS.Source.extend({
    'ajax': function(url, callback) {
        $.ajax(url, {
            'context': this,
            'success': function(result) {
                callback.call(this, result);
             }
        });
    },
    'showFeatureInfo': function(latlng, info) {
        $('.output').html(info);
    }
});
```

The following hooks are available:

Name | Description
-----|-------------
`getIdentifyLayers()` | Determine which layers to identify (default is all visible layers)
`getFeatureInfoParams(point, layers)` | Generate parameters for WMS `GetFeatureInfo` request
`ajax(url, callback)` | Actual AJAX call.  The default implementation is a rudimentary `XMLHttpRequest` wrapper.  Override this if you want to use jQuery or something with more robust support for older browsers.  If you override this, be sure to preserve the value of `this` when calling the callback function (e.g. `callback.call(this, result)`).
`parseFeatureInfo(result, url)` | Parse the AJAX response into HTML
`showFeatureInfo(latlng, info)` | Display parsed AJAX response to the user (e.g in a popup)
`showWaiting()` | Start AJAX wait animation (spinner, etc.)
`hideWaiting()` | Stop AJAX wait animation
